Book marketplace for Stuyvesant High School

> "I would like to have a marketplace for students to buy and sell books, which I understand students currently do through the 'Facebooks' and the 'tweets'. If I were a student, I would not just like to find a book, but for a book of mine to be recognized."

### Plans/Features
- Serial number, verify the actual book manually previously
- Automated search and verification of a book automatically (current eBay model)
- Tied to school email account
  - Simple response: "Good or bad"
  - Too long rating is a deterrant
    - Simplicity for rating on a seller/buyer for reputation
	- Preventing/reducing "no-show"
	  - Not so much dangerous for Stuyvesant students
  - Choose between multiple buyers with higher reputation
  - Anonmyous UNTIL buyer/seller confirms to _avoid_ personal bias: _only sees buyer names (maybe photos/avatar) after confirmation_
- May have a shortlist of proposed meeting spots in school: pre-offering meeting spots for security and community streamline reasons
  - Facilitating timely exchanges
- Any sort of known textbook, can request, buy, and offer to sell
  - A finite list of Barron's, Kaplan
  - What book within what topic, etc.
  - "Here are the list of textbooks we offer at this school"
- Emphasize fair trading and fair value rather than auction*
  - Reduces waste of textbooks that people no longer need
- Clear choice between Buyer/Seller option at the beginning of the website
- Comment section/forum for peer confirmation**

##### Expansions
- Study guide compilation (Midnightswam)
- Calculator marketplace, etc.
  - *Suggested Amount*: "Similar items have been sold for __ amount" 
- Notifications on smart device


** Not initial feature, may devolve into irrelevant chat **
